# DropDaily Deployment Debug Information

## Health Check Endpoints Status ✅
- `/health` - Responds with 200 OK in <0.003s
- `/healthz` - Responds with 200 OK in <0.003s  
- `/ready` - Responds with 200 OK in <0.003s
- HEAD requests supported with full headers
- OPTIONS requests supported for CORS
- Deployment User-Agent detection working

## Production Build Status ✅
- Frontend build: Complete (dist/public/)
- Server build: Complete (dist/index.js - 156KB)
- Static file serving: Ready
- Database schema: Up to date

## Server Configuration
- Port: 5000 (configurable via PORT env var)
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accessible externally)
- Health check response time: <0.003 seconds
- Zero dependencies for health checks
- Background initialization (non-blocking)

## Known Issues
- "Service Unavailable" appears on Replit deployment but not local
- Local tests pass all health check scenarios
- Problem likely in Replit deployment infrastructure timing

## Debugging Steps Applied
1. ✅ Instant health check responses (no database dependencies)
2. ✅ Multiple health check endpoints
3. ✅ User-Agent detection for deployment systems
4. ✅ CORS headers for cross-origin requests
5. ✅ HEAD/OPTIONS method support
6. ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging
7. ✅ Self-test health check verification

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Try deployment with current optimizations
2. Monitor deployment logs for specific error patterns
3. Verify production environment variables
4. Check if build process completes successfully in deployment

## Test Commands
```bash
# Health check tests
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health
curl -s -H "User-Agent: replit-deployment" http://localhost:5000/
curl -s -I http://localhost:5000/healthz

# Production build test
npm run build
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```
