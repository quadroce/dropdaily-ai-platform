## Data Flow

1. **Content Ingestion**:
   - External content sources (YouTube) → Content metadata extraction → AI topic classification → Vector embedding generation → Database storage

2. **User Onboarding**:
   - Registration → Topic preference selection → Profile vector generation → Onboarded status

3. **Daily Drop Generation**:
   - User preferences retrieval → Vector similarity matching → Content ranking → Daily drop creation → Delivery to user feed

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Content viewing → Engagement tracking → Bookmark management → Feedback loop for improved recommendations

- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend in production mode

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Monolithic Structure**: Single repository with shared types between client and server for rapid development and type safety
2. **Serverless Database**: Neon chosen for auto-scaling, built-in pgvector support, and minimal ops overhead
3. **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings provide high-quality semantic understanding for content matching
4. **Component Library**: shadcn/ui selected for customizable, accessible components with consistent design system
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Drizzle-Zod integration for runtime validation
6. **Session Management**: Simple localStorage-based auth suitable for MVP, with plans for more robust session handling

The architecture prioritizes rapid development while maintaining scalability for future growth, with clear separation between AI-powered content processing and user-facing features.
