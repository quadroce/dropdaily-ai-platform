# DropDaily - AI-Powered Content Discovery Platform

## Overview

DropDaily is an AI-powered content discovery platform that delivers personalized daily content feeds to busy professionals. The application uses AI embeddings and vector similarity matching to curate relevant content based on user preferences, delivering a "Daily Drop" of 1-3 carefully selected items per day.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Updates (July 29, 2025)

‚úÖ **SEO Optimization Completed**: Landing page enhanced with comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph data, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD structured data for improved search engine indexability.

‚úÖ **Routing Issues Resolved**: Fixed authentication flow routing - unauthenticated users see landing page and can access /login and /register properly, authenticated users are redirected appropriately.

üîß **RSS Image Extraction Enhanced**: Updated RSS parser to extract images from multiple formats (media:content, enclosures, HTML img tags) and store in image_url and thumbnail_url fields.

üé® **Source Attribution Improved**: ContentCard component now displays actual source names (Fast Company, TechCrunch, etc.) instead of "RSS" by extracting feed names and mapping domains to friendly names.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issue**: Some RSS feeds may not provide images in supported formats, fallback SVG placeholder continues to be used when no images are available.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a comprehensive shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Authentication**: Custom context-based authentication system with localStorage persistence

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Vector Search**: pgvector extension for content similarity matching using AI embeddings
- **Authentication**: bcrypt for password hashing with session-based auth
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive error handling

### AI Integration
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model for content vectorization with fallback system
- **Content Classification**: GPT-4 (gpt-4o) for intelligent topic classification with rule-based fallback
- **Matching Algorithm**: Vector similarity using cosine distance for personalized content recommendations

### RSS Content Ingestion System
- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Automated ingestion from 25 RSS feeds including TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired, etc.
- **Content Processing**: Real-time parsing, deduplication, and classification of 286+ articles
- **Fallback Classification**: Rule-based topic classification when OpenAI quota exceeded
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full RSS management interface at `/rss-admin` with statistics and manual controls

## Key Components

### User Management
- User registration and authentication with role-based access (user/admin)
- Onboarding flow with topic preference selection
- Profile management with preference weights

### Content System
- **Content Ingestion**: Automated ingestion from YouTube (initially) with plans for expansion
- **User Submissions**: Community-driven content submission with moderation workflow
- **Topic Classification**: AI-powered classification into predefined professional development topics
- **Vector Storage**: Content embeddings stored for similarity matching

### Daily Drop Algorithm ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Personalized Matching**: Active content matching based on user topic preferences (5 preferences for Francesco, 3 for admin)
- **AI-Powered Selection**: Successfully generating 3 daily drops per user with 0.8 match scores
- **Real Content Delivery**: Serving actual articles like "4 new AI tools that are worth your time"
- **Topic Targeting**: Precise AI/ML, Engineering, Business topic matching working
- **Fallback System**: Ensuring users always receive quality content when no perfect matches exist

### Admin Dashboard
- Content moderation interface for user submissions
- System statistics and analytics
- Automated content ingestion management

## Data Flow

1. **Content Ingestion**:
   - External content sources (YouTube) ‚Üí Content metadata extraction ‚Üí AI topic classification ‚Üí Vector embedding generation ‚Üí Database storage

2. **User Onboarding**:
   - Registration ‚Üí Topic preference selection ‚Üí Profile vector generation ‚Üí Onboarded status

3. **Daily Drop Generation**:
   - User preferences retrieval ‚Üí Vector similarity matching ‚Üí Content ranking ‚Üí Daily drop creation ‚Üí Delivery to user feed

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Content viewing ‚Üí Engagement tracking ‚Üí Bookmark management ‚Üí Feedback loop for improved recommendations

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL with pgvector support
- **OpenAI API**: Text embeddings and GPT-4 for content classification
- **YouTube API**: Content ingestion (initial source)

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database schema management and migrations
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management
- **Replit**: Development environment integration

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with HMR
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for consistent dev/prod environment
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management for OpenAI and database connections

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild compiles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations ensure schema consistency
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend in production mode

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Monolithic Structure**: Single repository with shared types between client and server for rapid development and type safety
2. **Serverless Database**: Neon chosen for auto-scaling, built-in pgvector support, and minimal ops overhead
3. **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings provide high-quality semantic understanding for content matching
4. **Component Library**: shadcn/ui selected for customizable, accessible components with consistent design system
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Drizzle-Zod integration for runtime validation
6. **Session Management**: Simple localStorage-based auth suitable for MVP, with plans for more robust session handling

The architecture prioritizes rapid development while maintaining scalability for future growth, with clear separation between AI-powered content processing and user-facing features.
